Construction on the New Central Library in downtown Los Angeles has begun! The new facility will be twice the size of the current one and is expected to be completed in 2019. It will include a new wing for special collections, a cafe, and a rooftop garden. The project is being funded by a $475 million bond measure that was approved by voters in 2016.
