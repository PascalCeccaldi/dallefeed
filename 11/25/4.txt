In recent years, "ngopi daring" or "daring to drink coffee" has become a popular catchphrase among young Indonesians. The phrase is often used to describe someone who is brave or fearless in the face of adversity.

This trend was started by a group of young coffee enthusiasts who wanted to promote the coffee culture in Indonesia. They started a coffee shop called "Ngopi Daring" which quickly became popular among young people.

The trend has now spread to other coffee shops and even some schools are teaching classes on "daring to drink coffee".

So what does it mean to be "ngopi daring"? It means to be brave enough to try new things, to step out of your comfort zone, and to have the courage to follow your dreams.

So if you're ever feeling stuck in a rut, remember that you can always be "ngopi daring" and try something new. Who knows, it might just lead to something great.
