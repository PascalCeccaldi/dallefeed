It's been a year since the Konya massacre, and the city is still in mourning. On December 10, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a group of people in a crowded marketplace in Konya, Turkey, killing nine and injuring dozens more. The attack was a devastating blow to the city, and its effects are still being felt today.

One year later, the city is still struggling to come to terms with what happened. The massacre was a senseless act of violence that left the community reeling. There are no easy answers, and the healing process will be long and difficult. But the people of Konya are determined to move forward, and they will never forget those who were lost.
