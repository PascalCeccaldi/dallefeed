The Golden Boot"

Kane "The Golden Boot" is currently the leading goal scorer in the Premier League, with 18 goals so far this season. The 24-year-old striker has been in red-hot form for Tottenham Hotspur, and looks set to finish the season as the league's top scorer. This would be a huge achievement for Kane, who has only been a regular starter for Spurs for the past two seasons. With Kane in such fine form, it is no wonder that Tottenham are currently challenging for the Premier League title.
