銀色暗号

A new trend is sweeping the nation, and it's called 銀色暗号.

This code, which can be read as "ginko no kakusu" in Japanese, is a way to send secret messages using nothing but silver coins.

To make the code, all you need is a silver coin and a black Sharpie. Write your message on the coin, using the Sharpie, and then give it to your friend.

They can then decode the message by rubbing the coin with a piece of cloth.

This trend is taking off because it's a fun and easy way to send secret messages. So get creative and start coding!
