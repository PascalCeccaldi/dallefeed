In recent years, the art world has been taken by storm by the "Dada" movement. This avant-garde style of art is characterized by its use of found objects, often with a political or humorous intent. While some have praised this movement for its innovative approach, others have criticized it for its lack of traditional beauty. Nonetheless, there is no denying that Dada is one of the most talked-about trends in the art world today.
