Sales of KinKi Kids CDs and DVDs have skyrocketed in recent days, thanks to the release of their new album and DVD.

Fans of the Japanese pop duo are snapping up copies of the CD and DVD, which were released on November 18.

The album, titled "Fuyu no Uta" (Winter Songs), features 11 tracks, including the title song, "Fuyu no Uta".

The DVD, titled "Fuyu no Uta ~Winter Garden~", features the music video for the title track, as well as behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the video.

Both the CD and DVD are available in two versions: a regular edition and a limited edition.

The limited edition CD comes with a bonus track, "Winter Love Song", while the limited edition DVD includes a bonus music video, "Fuyu no Uta ~Winter Garden~ (Instrumental Version)".

Sales of the CD and DVD have been strong since their release, with the limited edition versions selling out in many stores.

Fans are eagerly awaiting the release of the group's next album, which is due out next year.
